# 1D-CNN-with-DA-to-predict-geothermal-production

	A novel 1D-CNN was developed to predict geothermal production capacity
	Data augmentation techniques could improve model generalization and prediction accuracy
	A 1D-CNN combined with data augmentation can be used as a geothermal prediction method
	The application of data-driven can provide insights for developing a universal approach to the fields of geothermics.

More codes will be released in succession
